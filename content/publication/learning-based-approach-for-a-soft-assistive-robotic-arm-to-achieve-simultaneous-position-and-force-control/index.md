abstract: Soft robotics have demonstrated great advantages in assisting
  elderly/disabled people during daily tasks, owing to their highly dexterous
  motions and safe human-robot interactions. However, simultaneously controlling
  the position and force of soft robots is still a challenging task due to soft
  actuatorsâ€™ nonlinearity, system uncertainty, and high-dimensional control
  space. Classical control methods are usually based on
  first-principle/analytical models that are difficult to derive for soft robots
  without making significant simplifications. To overcome such control
  challenges, the central concept of this work is to introduce a learning-based
  data-driven approach. The approach employs a probabilistic model to explicitly
  capture system nonlinearity and uncertainty. Besides, nonparametric local
  learning methods are investigated to deal with redundant high-dimensional
  control space. The approach is applied in a soft robotic arm interacting with
  a manikin to simulate the bathing task. Experimental results demonstrate that
  the soft robotic arm could be well controlled to track the desired position
  and force simultaneously (maximum error of position and force is 6 mm and
  0.037 N). Meanwhile, our method outperforms another typical data-driven
  approach (maximum error of position and force is 10 mm and 0.058 N). The
  results indicate that our approach is helpful for soft robots because of the
  physical interactions needed in assistive tasks.
