  Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been
  steadily rising worldwide. Robotic colonoscopes provide new
  approaches to conduct colon inspection and treatment. This
  paper presented a novel electromagnetically actuated softtethered
  colonoscope to achieve precise and stable orientation
  control. An inflated balloon was designed to eliminate the
  unpredictable disturbance of the floating tether. A 2OR Pseudo-
  Rigid-Body (PRB) model of the soft tether was constructed
  to analyze the relationship between the tether deflection and
  applied force and torque. A closed-loop control framework was
  detailed with visual position feedback. Experiments were first
  conducted to validate the assumption of the PRB model and the
  efficacy of the magnetic field model. Then, trajectory tracking
  tasks and disturbance rejection tests were performed to validate
  the feasibility of the closed-loop control and developed system.
  Results show that the designed colonoscope was able to stably
  and accurately orient to the desired orientation under disturbance.
  The distal tip could quickly re-stabilize to the desired
  orientation even a large disturbance exists.
