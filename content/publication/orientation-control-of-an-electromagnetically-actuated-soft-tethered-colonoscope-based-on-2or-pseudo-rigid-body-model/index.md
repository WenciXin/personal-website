Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been
steadily rising worldwide. Robotic colonoscopes provide new
approaches to conduct colon inspection and treatment. This
paper presented a novel electromagnetically actuated softtethered
colonoscope to achieve precise and stable orientation
control. An inflated balloon was designed to eliminate the
unpredictable disturbance of the floating tether. A 2OR Pseudo-
Rigid-Body (PRB) model of the soft tether was constructed
to analyze the relationship between the tether deflection and
applied force and torque. A closed-loop control framework was
detailed with visual position feedback. Experiments were first
conducted to validate the assumption of the PRB model and the
efficacy of the magnetic field model. Then, trajectory tracking
tasks and disturbance rejection tests were performed to validate
the feasibility of the closed-loop control and developed system.
Results show that the designed colonoscope was able to stably
and accurately orient to the desired orientation under disturbance.
The distal tip could quickly re-stabilize to the desired
orientation even a large disturbance exists.
