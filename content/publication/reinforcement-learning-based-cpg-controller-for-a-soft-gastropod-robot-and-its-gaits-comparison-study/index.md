abstract: >-
  Bio-inspired robots, such as soft gastropod-like robots, have been developed
  to achieve environmental compatibility locomotion as their natural
  counterparts. However,

  it is difficult to determine the optimal locomotion gaits of

  these robots, as existing gaits in the biological animals are

  not easy to evaluate and compare. To investigate this problem,

  we propose a framework that employing deep reinforcement

  learning (deep RL) for high-level motion planning and central

  pattern generators (CPGs) for low-level motion control. Instead

  of controlling the robot with manually designed rules, the

  framework enables robots to select and control the locomotion

  gaits by themselves. This framework is verified with a soft

  gastropod robot. To train the RL agent, a virtual robotic

  locomotion environment is built based on the robot kinematics.

  Simulations and physical experiments show that the control

  framework can well help the robot to switch and control its

  three gaits to reach the target.
