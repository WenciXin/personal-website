abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) tract related diseases are common and deadly. To
  avoid the diseases developing into an advanced stage, early inspection and
  intervention are crucial. However, existing inspection methods are either
  uncomfortable or lack of active steering. Therefore, it is necessary to
  investigate a locomotion method that is friendly to the GI tract. This paper
  proposed a novel soft snail robot targeted for active locomotion inside the GI
  tract. By studying the locomotion mechanism of gastropods, a snail robot
  propelled with longitudinal travelling wave was designed. The wave was
  generated by deflating and inflating a series of chambers. The snail robot
  could adhere to different surfaces, including the ex vivo porcine intestine,
  by the mucus underneath. Experiments were designed to study the performance of
  the proposed snail robot. Results show that, the soft snail robot could crawl
  over different substrates including hard substrate, soft substrate and
  biological tissue. The speed of the snail is affected by multiple factors,
  including the surface condition, wave frequency and the mucus concentration.
