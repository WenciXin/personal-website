  To measure the tactile signals, such as magnitude, strain and especially
  direction, various types of sensors have been developed. However, these
  devices are either very complex in structureonly or only can obtain single signal. This work presents a novel soft tactile sensor with capacitance between liquid alloy based

  hemisphere and planar electrodes. Due to the nature high surface tension and flowability of liquid alloy droplet, the dynamic re-distribution of charges on electrodes

  can achieve high sensitivity, wide range and abundant functions, e.g. magnitude or direction of external force.
