abstract:For any other mask-based process, its resolution is often constrained by the quality of the mask, and the fabrication cost increases drastically with increased resolution. In this work, we introduced a sandwiched thermal shrink polymer film masking technique for fine liquid alloy patterns, which were demonstrated by only using a mechanical cutting plotter together with a common oven.
With the relaxing of the polymer chain, shrink polymer film can shrink to a certain ratio after heating. By introducing shrink polymer film masking, the mask resolution could be tuned in some range towards higher resolution so that it becomes sufficient for more applications in stretchable electronics. Also, with different pre-stretched methods and parameters in manufacturing, the shrink polymer film could shrink uniaxiallyor biaxiallywith different shrink ratios. Here, we have found means to control the shrink ratio precisely and developed it into three-dimensional (3D) applications.
