  With infinite degrees of freedom, soft robots are
  expected to achieve dexterous and complex tasks, but this also
  puts forward higher requirements for their sensing capabilities.
  An important sensing task in soft robots is sensing their own
  deformation and current shape. Currently, most of the existing
  soft shaping sensors are limited by local perception abilities,
  stretchability, and fabrication difficulties. We propose a sensing
  method based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), which
  reconstructs conductivity patterns distributed on a surface, by
  considering the deformation-caused resistance changes. Comparison
  between the theoretical and experimental patterns reveals
  that even though the quality of the pattern is affected by a large
  amount of noise, the considered features are still able to reflect the
  change of shape. With the help of neural networks, the pattern is
  decoded to the physical data related to the deformation. Detection
  of the planar shape changes and proprioception of a sensorintegrated
  soft robot are presented to exhibit the capability of our
  method. Results show that the detected error ratios are mostly
  under 5% and 3% for 2D and 3D conditions respectively.
