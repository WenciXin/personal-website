abstract: Soft robots with a well-balanced performance in terms of dexterity,
  accuracy, and payload have a great potential for application. Balancing safe
  human-robot interaction with operation performance enables the use of soft
  robot in biomedical fields, among others, such as surgery, rehabilitation and
  elder care. In this letter, we present a rod-driven soft robot (RDSR) where
  the flexible rods embedded in the silicone-based body provide a double
  push-pull actuation, to satisfy the needs of balanced performance. The RDSR
  can realize multi DOFs movement with elongation, contraction and bending. For
  trajectory tracking, Gaussian process model enables RDSR to achieve more
  accurate motion control with an RMSE within 2.8 mm compared to the constant
  curvature model with that within 10.8 mm. Comparative experiments demonstrate
  that the workspace, vertical and lateral stiffness of the RDSR are up to 5,
  2.6 and 5.2 times that of an analogous tendon-driven soft robot (TDSR),
  respectively. Additionally, the RDSR possesses the ability, that the TDSR does
  not have, to actively apply pushing perpendicular to an inclined plane. Based
  on numerical Jacobian matrix, the maximum force along target direction is
  greater than 4 N for a 30âˆ˜ plane. Furthermore, pick-and-place tests validate
  that our soft robot, with large workspace, precise and steady motion, is
  capable of conducting object manipulation tasks.
