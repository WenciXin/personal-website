abstract: Among numerous patterning techniques, masked liquid alloy printing is
  one of the most promising techniques for scalable fabrication of
  liquid-alloy-based stretchable electronics. Like any other mask-based process,
  its resolution is often constrained by the quality of the mask, and the
  fabrication cost increases drastically with increased resolution. In this
  work, by introducing a sandwiched thermal shrink polymer film masking
  technique and a corresponding intermediate release agent, fine liquid alloy
  patterns were demonstrated by using a mechanical cutting plotter together with
  a common oven. The final resolution and shape of the mask could be tuned based
  on the anisotropy of the shrink polymer film and other operational parameters
  of the technique. After shrinkage, the width of the patterned liquid alloy
  lines and space in-between could be tuned to less than one third of the
  original cut pattern, to about 35 and 60 μm, respectively, according to
  requirements. To better predict the final structure, several parameters were
  investigated experimentally and numerically. Finally, a liquid alloy strain
  sensor and three-dimensional conformal masking were demonstrated, showing the
  potential of the developed technique.
