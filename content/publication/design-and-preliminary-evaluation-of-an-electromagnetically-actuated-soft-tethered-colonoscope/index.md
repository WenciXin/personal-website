abstract: |-
  Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been steadily
  rising worldwide. Early screening and treatment by colonoscopy
  are critical in reducing both the incidence and mortality rate
  of CRC. The conventional flexible colonoscope (FC) requires
  high skills of the physicians and may lead to patient discomfort.
  Many novel techniques for colonoscopy have been developed,
  each of which has its own pros and cons. This paper proposes
  an electromagnetically actuated soft-tethered (EAST) colonoscope
  system to provide an alternative solution. The EAST colonoscope
  is competent in achieving complete functions of FC and reducing
  patient discomfort owing to the gentle interaction between the
  colonoscope and colon wall. Physical experimentation is conducted
  with a proof-of-concept actuation prototype to validate
  the feasibility of the EAST colonoscope. The experimental results
  show that the orientation can be controlled to follow the desired
  trajectories with a mean absolute error of 0.302 mm. Moreover,
  the system is demonstrated to achieve active locomotion and
  orientation in a colon phantom, while other operations such as
  insufflation, biopsy, and drug delivery are performed using a
  porcine colon, which indicates that the EAST colonoscope delivers
  high potentials in medical application.
