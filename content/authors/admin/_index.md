I am currently a Ph.D. student in the department of mechanical engineering, the National University of Singapore. I am supervised by Prof. Cecilia Laschi. Previously, I received my M.Phil. degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2021, and B.S. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019.
